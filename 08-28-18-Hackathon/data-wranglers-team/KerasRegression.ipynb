There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.\n",

      "This is a stunning, well-balanced late-harvest selection that's sure to be a welcome addition to any dessert course. Notes of ginger and sweet baking spice lift the baked-apple, peach and apricot-preserve fruit core. A kiss of honeyed sweetness and a soft, candied orange-peel flavor lingers on the close. Ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and lifted.\n",

      "Chapuy is a négociant based in Mesnil-sur-Oger in the Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte des Blancs. This wine, made from grapes sourced exclusively from grand cru vineyards, is all citrus, mineral and apple skin flavors. It's a tight, taut effort with a crisp texture and a note of grapefruit on the finish. Worth aging for a few months.\n",

      "This is as fine a rosé sparkling wine as has ever been produced in California. Almost 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, vanilla, toast and creamy lees, in the style of Champagne, and is completely dry and very crisp in acidity. Fabulously drinkable now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.\n",
      "Predicted:  92.393 Actual:  94 \n",
      "\n",
      "Plum and raspberry aromas are wiry in nature and “red” in character. The wine feels healthy and not overly heavy, with roasted, slightly herbal flavors of berry fruits and creamy oak. A spicy, lightly herbal finish ends this Malbec-Syrah-Merlot blend in solid fashion. Drink through 2015.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.5127 Actual:  90 \n",
      "\n",
      "Pungent, feline aromas of sweat and cactus set up a sharp, citric palate that's loaded to the brim with acidity. Austere flavors of passion fruit and lime end with a note of mango along with a wave of citric burn.\n",
      "Predicted:  84.4901 Actual:  85 \n",

      "\n",
      "Delicate whiffs of spice and pine lend depth to crisp-tart white peach and grapefruit flavors in this spry yet penetrating Riesling. Dry on the palate, it's finely textured, as if etched by its acidity and stony mineral tones. It finishes with juicy, concentrated stone fruit flair. Drinks well now but should meld beautifully through 2024.\n",
      "Predicted:  94.107 Actual:  94 \n",
      "\n",
      "A richly liquorous wine, ripe and packed with harmonious sweet textures. At the same time over the ripe structure there is a layer of lively lemon, spice and ginger, spiked with fresh tangerines. The end result is smooth, balanced and vibrant.\n",
      "Predicted:  92.4005 Actual:  93 \n",
      "\n",
      "While a touch candied and confected in style, this Cabernet Sauvignon is chock full of ripe, rich black cherry and berry flavors. Plush and juicy, it's best enjoyed in its youth.\n",
      "Predicted:  87.344 Actual:  86 \n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet caramelized flavors of crème brûlée dominate in this wine that is showy in oak with sharp layers of green apple, melon and lime.\n",
      "Predicted:  86.0062 Actual:  84 \n",
      "\n",
      "Spicy and stout on the nose, this delivers graphite, blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is young, choppy and tannic in feel, with racy, raw flavors of ripe tomato and blackberry accented by carob and chocolate. Dry tannins on the finish support lightly baked berry flavors. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "Predicted:  90.1209 Actual:  89 \n",
      "\n",
      "Fire up the grill, or pan fry a juicy steak to eat with this robust red wine, a Bordeaux blend with 24% Syrah. It's bone dry and tannic and juicy in berries, cherries, currants, leather and herbs, and while it's an easy sipper, the structure was harder to achieve than you might think.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although the wine is mature, it also has freshness that comes through strongly as aromatic and yellow-fruit driven. The acidity is intense, full of character while fruitiness continues right to the end.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.6299 Actual:  90 \n",
      "\n",
      "A flowery Chardonnay with delicate, almost evanescent flavors of buttercup, buttered toast and grapefruit. It seems overly strong in oak and weak in fruit, showing a minerally spine and raw alcohol. Clean and bone dry, but lacks richness and vibrancy.\n",
      "Predicted:  84.7237 Actual:  85 \n",
      "\n",
      "Relatively light for the variety, this wine has lots of tasty, almost jammy fruit flavors, medium tannins and a smooth but gripping texture. It's very good to drink now.\n",

      "\n",
      "Light aromas of white flowers and lemon show on the very restrained nose of this bottling by the pioneering Niven family. The acidity is well integrated on the sip, and there is subtle tannic framing, with delicate lemon water and chamomile flavors.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.0345 Actual:  89 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling—an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.\n",

There is a lovely purity of fruit, mixed red fruits, plum and cherry. A mere hint of chocolate shavings, but the oak is minimal, perhaps too minimal.\n",
